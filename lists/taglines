The trusty lantern gutters; deeper shadows stir.
The lantern's light thins; the corridor forgets its walls.
The wick falters; something learns to breathe in dark.
Your lantern whispers low; the ruins answer lower.
The flame leans left, as if listening for footsteps.
The lantern's glow puddles; the floor seems deeper than stone.
The halo shrinks; the night remembers your name.
Oil runs thin; silhouettes grow teeth.
A lantern’s last inch of courage holds the line.
The glass fogs; maps fold themselves in shadow.
The light flickers twice; both times something moves.
Your lantern steadies; the silence does not.
Soot blooms; the dark practices its smile.
The flame nods; the hall nods back.
The lantern hums low; the growing shadows hum lower.
Warm light recedes; cold corners multiply.
The wick protests; the passageway agrees.
The lantern's light is wan, the corridor long, the breath not yours.
The glow wavers; the path wavers less.
A tired flame, a patient abyss.
